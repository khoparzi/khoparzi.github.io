Abhinay Khoparzi is a multidisciplinary creative technologist who maintains a practice across film, video, music and web technologies. He has had a long relationship with the experimental electronic music scene in Mumbai with performances at The Indian Electronica Festival (Blue Frog, 2008), 6 Foot Oscillator in a 4 foot Room (Zenzi Mills, 2009), One Sunday (H20, 2011). He is also known for his association with pioneering web platform, netlabel, and publishing company 3rd Thought Entertainment and his filmmaking work with Empatheia Films.

Abhinay is one of the co-instigators of Algorave India, a collective of artists, musicians, and visualists intent on promoting programming as performance art through events called Algoraves. As an extension of this he has performed with live coding platforms TidalCycles and Hydra at Fat Finger Mayhem (Max Mueller Bhavan, Mumbai, 2018 and 2019), Algorave Sheffield (UK, 2018), International Conference of Live Coding (Madrid, 2019), Distributed Culture Conference (Argentina/UK, 2020), Algoritmi Remote Algorave (Torino, Italy, 2020) and organised/curated multiple independent Algoraves in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore.

Since 2018 I have been collaborating with artists from all over the world with network music performances with the intercontinental live coding ensemble Supercontinent. SuperContinent is a project led by David Ogborn of the McMasters University Networked Imagination Lab and has artists that are each at least 3000 kms apart and perform on a unique performance platform called Estuary. Earlier in 2020 I also started playing with another remote ensemble called Algomech that is a collaboration between CiLC Argentina and Algorave India.
