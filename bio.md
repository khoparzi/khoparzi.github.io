Abhinay is one of the co-instigators of Algorave India, a collective of artists, musicians, and visualists intent on promoting programming as performance art through events called Algoraves.

Since 2018 Abhinay has been collaborating with artists from all over the world with network music performances with the intercontinental live coding ensemble Supercontinent. SuperContinent is a project led by David Ogborn of the McMasters University Networked Imagination Lab and has artists that are each at least 3000 kms apart and perform on a unique performance platform called Estuary. Earlier in 2020 Abhinay also started playing with another remote ensemble called Algomech that is a collaboration between CiLC Argentina and Algorave India.
